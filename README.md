Hammer - the CLI tool (not only) for Foreman
============================================


Hammer is a generic [clamp-based](https://github.com/mdub/clamp) CLI framework.
Hammer-cli provides just the core functionality. The core is extensible using plugins that contain application-specific commands.

This architecture allows for easy customization according to your application. Nearly any Ruby script can be turned into a Hammer command, so the possibilities are endless.

Available plugins are currently:
  - [hammer-cli-foreman](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli-foreman)  - commands corresponding to Foreman API
  - [hammer-cli-katello-bridge](https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli-katello-bridge) - set of commands provided by Katello CLI

You also can easily add custom commands for your specific use, such as bulk actions or admin tasks.


Installation
------------

Hammer CLI is packaged for the following RPM based distributions:

 - RHEL and derivatives, version 6
 - Fedora 18, 19
 - Debian Wheezy, Squeezy
 - Ubuntu Precise

### Installation from RPMs

#### Step 1: setup yum repositories

For Foreman 1.3 stable the hammer packages are part of your installation repo and you can skip this step.

You can choose from stable or nightly repo. Nightly has more recent version of hammer packages, but it was subject to less testing so there is a higher risk of issues.
Add the Foreman yum repository to your yum repo files. For Fedora installations replace 'el6' with 'f18' or 'f19' as appropriate.


Using stable

```bash
yum -y install http://yum.theforeman.org/releases/1.3/el6/x86_64/foreman-release.rpm
```

or nightly

```bash
cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/foreman.repo << EOF
[foreman]
name=Foreman Nightly
baseurl=http://yum.theforeman.org/nightly/el6/x86_64
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
EOF
```

On RHEL systems you will also have to add [EPEL repository](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL) as it contains some of the required dependencies.


#### Step 2: install hammer core

```bash
yum install rubygem-hammer_cli
```

#### Step 3: install plugins
Currently, there are two plugins, both available as rpm packages.

 - commands for managing foreman

```bash
yum install rubygem-hammer_cli_foreman
```

 - 1:1 bridge to [katello cli](https://github.com/Katello/katello)

```bash
yum install rubygem-hammer_cli_katello_bridge
```

To install any other hammer plugin just make sure the appropriate gem is installed and follow with the configuration.


### Installation from DEBs

#### Step 1: setup apt repositories

For Foreman 1.3 stable the hammer packages are part of your installation repo and you can skip this step.

You can choose from stable or nightly repo. Nightly has more recent version of hammer packages, but it was subject to less testing so there is a highr risk of issues.

Choose stable (don't forget to replace "squeeze" with version name of your system)

```bash
echo "deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ squeeze stable" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/foreman.list
```

or nightly

```bash
echo "deb http://deb.theforeman.org/ squeeze nightly" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/foreman.list
```

and update the keys

```bash
wget -q http://deb.theforeman.org/foreman.asc -O- | apt-key add -
```

#### Step 2: install hammer core

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install ruby-hammer-cli
```

#### Step 3: install plugins
Currently, there are two plugins, both available as deb packages.

 - commands for managing foreman

```bash
$ apt-get install ruby-hammer-cli-foreman
```

 - 1:1 bridge to [katello cli](https://github.com/Katello/katello)

```bash
$ apt-get install ruby-hammer-cli-katello-bridge
```

To install any other hammer plugin just make sure the appropriate gem is installed and follow with the configuration.


### Installation from GEMs

Make sure you have ```gem``` command installed on your system

#### Step 1: install hammer core

```bash
$ gem install hammer_cli
```

#### Step 2: install plugins
Currently, there are two plugins, both available on rubygems.org

 - commands for managing foreman

```bash
$ gem install hammer_cli_foreman
```

 - 1:1 bridge to [katello cli](https://github.com/Katello/katello)

```bash
$ gem install hammer_cli_katello_bridge
```

To install any other hammer plugin just install the appropriate gem and follow with the configuration.


### Installation from SOURCE

If you can install hammer from git checkouts, you will just need ```rake``` installed on your system.
Clone and install CLI core

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli.git
$ cd hammer-cli
$ rake install
$ cd ..
```

clone plugin with foreman commands

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/theforeman/hammer-cli-foreman.git
$ cd hammer-cli-foreman
$ rake install
$ cd ..
```

and optionally other plugins via any of the methods mentioned above.


Configuration
-------------

### Format and locations

Configuration is set based on the following files, loaded in this order:

 - ```/etc/foreman/cli_config.yml```.
 - ```/usr/local/etc/foreman/cli_config.yml```.
 - ```~/.foreman/cli_config.yml```
 - ```./config/cli_config.yml``` (config dir in CWD)
 - custom location specified on command line - ```-c CONF_FILE_PATH```

Later files have precedence if they redefines the same option.

Hammer uses yaml formatting for its configuration. The config file template is contained in the hammer_cli gem

 ```bash
gem contents hammer_cli|grep cli_config.template.yml
```
and can be copied to one of the locations above and changed as needed. The packaged version of hammer copies the template to /etc for you.


### Plugins

Plugins are disabled by default. You have to edit the config file and enable them manually under ```modules``` option, as can be seen in the sample config below.

Plugin specific configuration should be nested under plugin's name.

### Options

 - ```:log_dir: <path>``` - directory where the logs are stored. The default is ```/var/log/foreman/``` and the log file is named ```hammer.log```
 - ```:log_level: <level>``` - logging level. One of ```debug```, ```info```, ```warning```, ```error```, ```fatal```
 - ```:log_owner: <owner>``` - logfile owner
 - ```:log_group: <group>``` - logfile group
 - ```:log_size: 1048576``` - size in bytes, when exceeded the log rotates. Default is 1MB
 - ```:watch_plain: false``` - turn on/off syntax highlighting of data being logged in debug mode

### Sample config

```yaml
:modules:
    - hammer_cli_foreman
    - hammer_cli_katello_bridge

:foreman:
    :host: 'https://localhost/'
    :username: 'admin'
    :password: 'changeme'

:katello_bridge:
    :cli_description: '/home/mbacovsk/work/theforeman/hammer-cli-katello-bridge/katello.json'


:log_dir: '/var/log/foreman/'
:log_level: 'debug'
```

Autocompletion
--------------

It is necessary to copy the hammer_cli_complete script to the bash_completion.d directory.

    $ sudo cp hammer-cli/hammer_cli_complete /etc/bash_completion.d/

Then after starting a new shell the completion should work.
